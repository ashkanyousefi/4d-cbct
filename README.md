# 4d-cbct
A deep convolutional neural network model (based on the 'U-Net') to enhance the image quality of 4-D Cone Beam CT

## Objective
In this project, inspired by the SPARE Challenge (http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/image-x/research/SPARE-Challenge.php), we are investigating the performance of deep learning models to improve the quality of 4-dimensional cone-beam CT images. In particular, we have implemented a deep-convolutional neural network based on the 'U-Net' architecture (Ronneberger et al 2015).

## The Model
